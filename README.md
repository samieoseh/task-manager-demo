# React TypeScript Kanban Board

This project is a Kanban Board application built with React and TypeScript, featuring a custom `useForm` hook for form management and styled with `shadcn` components. It provides an interactive way to manage tasks in a Kanban-style interface, allowing users to add, edit, and move tasks across different columns representing different stages of a workflow. This project is bootstrapped with Vite for a fast and efficient development experience.
